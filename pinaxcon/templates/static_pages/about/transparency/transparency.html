<h2>Program Transparency Report</h2>

<p><span class="date">Tuesday, October 24, 2017</span>&mdash;The PyArkansas organizing team's goal is to build a program with sessions and keynotes that are valuable to the attendees, and to do so ethically. We recognized some known issues, and that our knowledge is limited, so we reached out to the community and took steps to run the best and most fair program building process we could.</p>
