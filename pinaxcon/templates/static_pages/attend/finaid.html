<h2>What We'll Cover</h2>

<p>Our mission is to provide an accessible Python conference to everyone in Northern California. We understand that some people will need to travel for 2 or more hours to get to Petaluma, and that the costs of transport and lodging can add up. Our grants are intended to make your weekend at PyArkansas cost about as much as a weekend at home would cost.</p>

<p>If you're selected to receive financial aid, we'll cover the following for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ground transportation</strong>, up to $70 return: including public transit, including reasonable cab/rideshare fares between the venue and accommodation in Petaluma.</li>
  <li><strong>Accommodation subsidy</strong>, up to $80 per night, for up to 3 nights.</li>
  <li><strong>Free ticket</strong> to the conference.</li>
</ul>

<p>These subsidies are designed to make the conference affordable, no matter where you live in Northern California. You are still eligible even if you don't live close to Petaluma, however, we will not subsidise the cost of flights.</p>
