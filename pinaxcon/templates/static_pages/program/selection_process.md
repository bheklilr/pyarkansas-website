PyArkansas is using a two-phase review process for 2018. This is intended to allow
attendees and others interested in PyArkansas to have input in the talk selection
decision while leaving the final program curation up to the [Program Co-Chairs](/2018/about/team).

## Phase One: Ranking of anonymized proposals

During this phase, the reviewers will score each proposal solely on the title,
description, and abstract contents. Other proposal fields will be hidden
including any identifying information or notes about the speaker(s) proposing
the talk.

Anyone interested in helping provide input is invited to
[become a reviewer](/2018/program/review-proposals).

## Phase Two: Identity-aware curation and selection

The [Program Co-Chairs](/2018/about/team) will use the scored proposals in conjunction with speaker
profiles to rank and organize a program while ensuring diversity of speakers
and topics.
